<details><summary>Click Me</summary>

AngelOn currently uses MongoDB database through [<code>@nestjs/mongoose</code>.](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/mongodb) .

We **recommend** you to use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database). Their free tier service will allow you to deploy MongoDB using the provider and region of your choice between Amazon AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.

If you are going to deploy MongoDB manually, be sure to a [replica set](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/replication/).

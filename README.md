AngelOn API

AngelOn API is the backend implementation for the [AngelOn suite]().

REST services provided using [Nest.js framework](http://nestjs.com) and other [Tools]().

## Deployment

AngelOn currently uses *MongoDB* database through [Mongoose.](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/mongodb) by <code>@nestjs/mongoose</code>.

We **recommend** you to use [*MongoDB Atlas*](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database). Their free tier service will allow you to deploy MongoDB using the provider and region of your choice between *AWS*, *Google* and *Azure*.

If you are going to deploy MongoDb manually, be sure to a [replica set](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/replication/).
